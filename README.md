# Tube Status
A bit of simple fun to fetch tube status from the Transport For London API.

The status is updated every 5 minutes.

Made a little more interesting by styling the front end to look like a mobile phone.

This was completed as part of a Software Engineering Immersive 3-month course at General Assembly London.
